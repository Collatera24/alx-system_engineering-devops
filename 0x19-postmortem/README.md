Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging #1 on May 2, 2024
Issue Summary:
Duration: May 2, 2024, 10:00AM - 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: Significant degradation of service with intermittent outages. Approximately 30% of users experienced slow response times or were unable to access the platform.
Root Cause: Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation was not listening on port 80 due to a misconfiguration in the application server.
Timeline:
10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts by an engineer, indicating increased response times.
10:05 AM: Engineering team notified about the performance degradation.
10:15 AM: Initial investigation focused on network port binding.
10:45 AM: Assumption made that increased traffic was causing the slowdown.
11:30 AM: Inspection of Docker container error was carried out..
12:00 PM: Engineering team identified Nginx misconfiguration as the probable cause.
1:00 PM: Ensured that the ‘listen’ directive is correctly set.
2:00 PM: Service fully restored after setting the ‘listen’ directive and avoiding syntax error .
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a result of syntax errors and misconfiguration of ’listen’ directive thereby causing the Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation not to listen to port 80 .
Resolution: The issue was resolved Ensured that the ‘listen’ directive is correctly set.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Review and optimize connection configurations for all application servers to prevent future exhaustion.
Test the configuration for syntax errors.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to proactively detect if there is any form of misconfiguration to prevent service degradation.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Update connection pool configurations on all application servers to accommodate peak traffic.
Implement automated scaling mechanisms for connection pools.
Patch Nginx server patch and add monitoring on server memory.
Conduct regular performance testing to identify and address potential bottlenecks before they impact users.
Review incident response procedures to streamline communication and escalation processes during outages.
Conclusion: The web stack debugging #1 on May 2, 2024, was caused by misconfiguration of the Nginx server thereby causing the Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation to not listen on port 80 . Through prompt detection, investigation, and collaboration between teams, the issue was identified and resolved within four hours. Implementing corrective measures and proactive monitoring will help prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable service for our users.
